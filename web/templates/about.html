  <h1 class="title">ðŸ“˜ About Aitana E-Waste</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Aitana</strong> is a smart image-based classification system designed to help communities manage
    electronic waste in a more sustainable and creative way. This project focuses on the Eastleigh neighborhood in Nairobi,
    where e-waste is a growing concern due to dense population and electronics trade.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using machine learning, Aitana identifies common discarded electronics such as mobile phones, laptops,
    televisions, and printers. Once identified, the system suggests practical <strong>reuse or upcycling ideas</strong>,
    helping users reduce waste and support a circular economy.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering capstone at the African Leadership University.
    It aims to promote environmental awareness, empower local communities, and reduce health and pollution risks
    associated with e-waste.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technologies used include <strong>image classification (CNNs)</strong>, <strong>FastAPI/Flask</strong> for backend deployment.
